IMPORTANT: Never use implicit print or implicit output, it does not work! If you need output of your code, you MUST use print() or console.log() to output selected variables. 
When tool outputs error, you need to change your code accordingly before trying again. online_knowledge_tool can help analyze errors.
Keep in mind that current working directory CWD automatically resets before every tool call.
IMPORTANT!: Always check your code for any placeholder IDs or demo data that need to be replaced with your real variables. Do not simply reuse code snippets from tutorials.
**Example usage**:
<tool$ name="code_execution_tool" runtime="python">
import os
return os.getcwd()
</tool$>
